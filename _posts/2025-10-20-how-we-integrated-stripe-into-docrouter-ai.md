At [DocRouter.AI](http://docrouter.ai), we build an AI app for processing documents using LLMs. As our user base grew, we needed a reliable way to handle billing for self-serve customers. This post explains our Stripe integration, focusing on key design choices. We'll cover why we chose Stripe, how we keep things flexible, pricing decisions, APIs used, and more.

## Why Use Stripe?

Stripe handles the credit card transactions, and handles global currencies/taxes. For an AI app with variable usage, it's essential — manual billing would be error-prone and slow. Companies using Stripe don't need to deal with credit cards. They only need to identify the customers by a unique customer ID managed by Stripe.

## How Stripe Payments Get Handled

Stripe supports: 
- __subscriptions__ for recurring plans
- __one-time charges__ for credits, 
- __webhooks__ for real-time updates.

It also supports __metered__ charges, but we will not use the __Stripe__ implementation for meters. It is more convenient to implement our own __metered__ support, keeping track on our platform of usage, and charge through __Stripe__ the monthly cost.

## SPU Credits

On [DocRouter.AI](http://docrouter.ai), customers purchase credits called __SPUs__ (Service Processing Units) - this is our abstraction for document page processing, and for LLM token use. Many other SAAS companies use a credit-purchase based mechanism. For example, Databricks measures credits as __DBUs__ (Databricks Processing Units), and charges hourly cluster usage a number of __DBUs__ that depends on the cluster size.

As long as the credit units are tied to predictable units of operation - for example, number of pages processed in a document - a credit purchase mechanism is a good choice.

## Pricing Strategy For AI Products

When setting up pricing through Stripe, you have to be strategic. You need to cover the needs of Enterprise customers, but also small companies and occasional users. Some customers prefer to purchase credits a-la-carte, while others prefer the predictability of a monthly subscription.

Pricing must be tailored to all types of customers you have at the current stage - and, has to be as simple as possible.

The diagram below describes different pricing strategies practiced in the industry:

![Pricing Strategies for AI](/assets/images/stripe_AI_pricing_strategy.png)

Ideally, products would be priced with an __Outcome-Base Model__ (top right quadrant). This works well if a business is vertical in an industry, and if product value has high attribution.

DocRouter.AI is a horizontal, data-layer product - and uses a __Hybrid Pricing Model__ based on monthly subscriptions and/or a-la-carte __SPU__ credit purchases.

## [DocRouter.AI](http://docrouter.ai) Software Stack
- The DocRouter.AI front end is __Next.JS__, with __Next.Auth__ user authentication
- The back end is __Fast API__ 
- Our database is __MongoDB__

DocRouter supports [agentic __Claude Code__ integration and __MCP__](https://docrouter.ai/docs/mcp/), allowing document workflows to be controlled through a simple chat interface.

Users control all DocRouter.AI functions either through the UI, or through [__REST APIs__](https://docrouter.ai/docs/rest-api/), using access tokens. A [__Python SDK__](https://docrouter.ai/docs/python-sdk/) and a [__Typescript SDK__](https://docrouter.ai/docs/typescript-sdk/) are available.

Having the flexibility to control DocRouter programmatically, either through agentic interfacing, or through APIs is great. 

However, use tracking (aka metered billing) has to be automated, and the customer needs to be charged a small percentage above the underlying cost charged by LLM and cloud providers.

Stripe integration is, thus, an essential ingredient in making this kind of programmatic integration possible.

## Free Tier, Plans, and A-La-Carte Credits

When you are starting, the best pricing is a simple one that your customer understands - especially for self-onboaded customers.

For DocRouter, we want users to start free, upgrade to plans, and be able to buy extra credits without friction. Here's how we did it:

![DocRouter Pricing Plans](/assets/images/docrouter_pricing.png)

New orgs get 100 granted SPUs (no card needed). Additional credits can be purchased. Users can subscribe to an __Individual__ or __Team__ plan, at a discount over the a-la-carte credits price. Or, they can select the __Enterprise__ plan, which is invoiced outside of Stripe where we can charge based on the customer outcomes (aka outcomes-based pricing).

## Prices for large vs. small customers

The __business__ challenge here is for the pricing scheme to be flexible enough to accommodate large __enterprise__ usage, at custom prices - while also allowing __self-onboarded__ customers. 

Consumption waterfall: allowance first, then purchased, then granted. Keeps costs low for light users, upsell for heavy ones.

The prices need to be in line with what is usually charged for document AI processing - while also capturing the value of more advanced, custom document workflows.

## Price changing flexibility

The __engineering__ challenge is, on the other hand, in how to create this pricing structure in __Stripe__, and ensure the variable part of the config (amounts, utilization thresholds) resides in __Stripe__ configuration rather than local __DocRouter.AI__ code. 

Updating amounts or utilization thresholds at a later time should not require coding changes in DocRouter.AI. These updates should be possible by merely chaging price configuration in __Stripe__.

Pricing updates, however, does not impact existing customers (aka grandfathering).

How does it all work?

## Environment Variables

Three Stripe-related environment variables are configured for integration:

**`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`** - Your Stripe API key for authentication. Required to enable Stripe integration.

**`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`** - Secret for verifying __webhook__ signatures. The DocRouter.AI __webhook__ is called by Stripe when various events happen: a user started or stopped a subscription, or purchased a-la-carte __SPU__ credits.

**`STRIPE_PRODUCT_TAG`** - The product identifier in metadata (default: `"doc_router"`). Allows filtering prices to find only those belonging to your product.

If `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is not set, Stripe integration is disabled and DocRouter operates in local-only mode.

## The Stripe Product and Price metadata

__Stripe__ uses the following 'objects': __Products__, __Prices__ (multiple per product), __Users__ (one per customer), and __Subscriptions__ (each with one or more __Prices__.

<div class="flex justify-center my-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/stripe_doc_router_diagram.png" alt="Stripe DocRouter.AI Diagram">
</div>

We could identify the __Products__ and the __Prices__ by stripe IDs saved as environment variables, similar to how we use the __STRIPE_SECRET_KEY__. However, that is not an advantageous way to set things up.

Instead, we detect Products and Prices by reading their __metadata__ in __Stripe__, and filtering for the Products and Prices configured for our company.

This way, a single Stripe account can be used as an umbrella for potentially multiple products, allowing for future extensibility.

- We create a Stripe __DocRouter Product__ 
![DocRouter Product](/assets/images/stripe_product.png)

- And we assign it a `product=doc_router` key/value in the __price metadata__. The __DocRouter.AI__ software detects the product using the Stripe Python API, filtering all products to find specifically the one with this key/value.
![DocRouter Product Metadata](/assets/images/stripe_product_metadata.png)

- We create two _recurring_ __Prices__ we'll use for monthly subscriptions: the __Individual Price__, and the __Team Price__. We again use _metadata_ to auto-detect the prices:
  - The __Individual Price__ has metadata __included_spus=5000__, __price_type=base__, __tier=individual__.
  - The __Team Price__ has __included_spus=25000__, __price_type=base__, __tier=team__

<div class="flex justify-center my-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/stripe_price_metadata.png" alt="DocRouter Price Metadata" class="w-1/2">
</div>

The DocRouter.AI detects the prices and the tier limits from the metadata.

## Python APIs for Retrieving Products and Prices

DocRouter.AI uses the Stripe Python SDK to dynamically fetch pricing configuration at startup. The complete implementation can be found in our [payments.py](https://github.com/analytiq-hub/doc-router/blob/main/packages/python/docrouter_app/routes/payments.py) file. Here's how the key parts work:

### Retrieving All Prices with Product Data

```python
prices = stripe.Price.list(active=True, expand=['data.product'])
```

The `expand=['data.product']` parameter loads the full product object (including metadata) alongside each price in a single API call.

### Filtering by Product Metadata

```python
product_prices = [
    price for price in prices.data
    if price.product.metadata.get('product') == 'doc_router'
]
```

This filters prices to only those belonging to our DocRouter product.

### Parsing Price Metadata

```python
for price in product_prices:
    metadata = price.metadata
    price_type = metadata.get('price_type')

    if price_type == 'base':
        tier = metadata.get('tier')
        included_spus = metadata.get('included_spus')
        # Store tier limits for subscription plans
```

All pricing configuration lives in Stripe—we can update prices and tier limits without code changes.

### Wrapping Stripe APIs for Async

Since DocRouter.AI uses FastAPI (an async framework), we wrap Stripe's synchronous API calls to run in a thread pool:

```python
async def _run_in_threadpool(func, *args, **kwargs):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    return await loop.run_in_executor(None, partial(func, *args, **kwargs))
```

This prevents blocking the event loop. In practice, we call:

```python
prices = await _run_in_threadpool(
    stripe.Price.list,
    active=True,
    expand=['data.product']
)
```

The wrapper runs the synchronous `stripe.Price.list()` in a separate thread, keeping our async FastAPI endpoints responsive.

## Stripe Checkout and Billing Portal

### Purchasing Credits

When users buy a-la-carte credits, we create a Stripe Checkout session:

```python
session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    customer=stripe_customer_id,
    payment_method_types=['card'],
    line_items=[{...}],
    success_url=success_url,
    cancel_url=cancel_url,
    metadata={'org_id': org_id, 'credits': credits}
)
```

<div class="flex justify-center my-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/stripe_payment_portal.png" alt="Stripe Payment Portal">
</div>

Users are redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout page—we never see their credit card details. Stripe handles all payment security.

### Managing Subscriptions

For subscription management, we use Stripe's Billing Portal:

```python
session = stripe.billing_portal.Session.create(
    customer=stripe_customer_id,
    return_url=return_url
)
```

The portal lets users update payment methods, view invoices, and cancel subscriptions—all handled by Stripe.

## Webhooks and Synchronization

Stripe sends webhooks for important events. We verify and process them:

```python
event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
    payload,
    signature_header,
    webhook_secret
)
```

Key events we handle:
- `checkout.session.completed` - Add purchased credits
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Sync subscription changes
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Clear subscription data
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Record successful payments

To prevent double-crediting, we track processed transactions in the `db.payments_credit_transactions` collection.

On startup and via webhooks, we sync __Stripe__ data to __MongoDB__. This keeps local data fresh without constant API calls.

## MongoDB Schema

We store payment data in MongoDB collections:

**`payments_customers`** - One document per organization:
```javascript
{
  org_id: "...",
  user_id: "...",
  stripe_customer_id: "cus_...",
  user_name: "...",
  user_email: "...",

  // Subscription fields
  subscription_type: "individual" | "team" | "enterprise",
  subscription_spu_allowance: 5000,
  subscription_spus_used: 1234,  // Reset each billing period
  stripe_subscription_id: "sub_...",
  stripe_subscription_item_id: "si_...",
  stripe_subscription_status: "active",
  stripe_current_billing_period_start: 1234567890,
  stripe_current_billing_period_end: 1237246290,

  // Credit fields
  purchased_credits: 10000,
  purchased_credits_used: 5000,
  granted_credits: 100,
  granted_credits_used: 50,

  // Metadata
  created_at: ISODate(...),
  updated_at: ISODate(...),
  subscription_updated_at: ISODate(...)
}
```

Subscription SPU usage (`subscription_spus_used`) is atomically reset each billing period. Subscription allowances renew monthly. Purchased and granted credits persist until consumed.

**`payments_credit_transactions`** - Audit trail for credit purchases:
```javascript
{
  session_id: "cs_...",
  org_id: "...",
  credits: 1000,
  processed_at: ISODate(...)
}
```

**`payments_usage_records`** - Log of all SPU usage:
```javascript
{
  org_id: "...",
  spus: 42,
  operation: "document_processing",
  source: "backend",
  timestamp: ISODate(...),
  llm_provider: "anthropic",
  llm_model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  prompt_tokens: 1234,
  completion_tokens: 567,
  total_tokens: 1801,
  actual_cost: 0.023
}
```

## Tracking SPU Usage

When LLM calls are made, we increment SPU usage:

```python
async def record_payment_usage(org_id, spus):
    # Consumption order: subscription → purchased → granted
    balances = await get_current_balances(db, org_id)
    consumption = calculate_consumption_breakdown(spus, balances)

    # Update balances atomically
    await update_customer_balances(db, customer_id, consumption)

    # Save usage record
    await save_complete_usage_record(db, org_id, spus, consumption)
```

The consumption waterfall ensures subscription credits are used first, then purchased, then granted.

Users view their credit utilization on the usage page. All data comes from MongoDB — no Stripe API calls needed to track usage, keeping the UI fast.

## Development and Testing with Stripe

Stripe provides separate test and production environments. During development, we use **test mode** keys:

```bash
# .env for development
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PRODUCT_TAG=doc_router
```

Test mode keys (`sk_test_*`) access a completely separate sandbox with its own customers, subscriptions, and products. You can:

- Create test products and prices in the Stripe Dashboard
- Use test credit cards (like `4242 4242 4242 4242`) for checkout
- Trigger webhooks manually to test event handling
- View all transactions without affecting production data

For production, swap to live keys (`sk_live_*`). The same code works in both modes—Stripe automatically routes API calls to the correct environment based on the key prefix.

This separation lets us develop and debug payment flows safely without risking real customer data or charges.

## Need Help with Your Pricing Strategy?

Take what you are thinking and try __10x that price__ for a fixed price. If they say yes, everyone is happy. If they say no, you can talk about fair pricing for the value you are providing for their business (aka Outcome-based pricing) typically aligned of a cost/revenue metric that matters a lot to your customer.
